## Overview

Certified Organic SEO integrates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) with no-code implementations to automatically append the keyword `organic` to every search query. By doing so, the framework:
- Prioritizes content that is certified (e.g., USDA Organic, EU Organic).
- Enhances consumer trust through verifiable certification information.
- Empowers ethical consumerism and supports sustainable practices.

This project also includes specialized frameworks:
- **Google Organics:** An adaptation of Google’s search engine with built-in organic filtering.
- **Bing Organics:** A parallel system designed for Bing, delivering organic-centric search results.

Usage Instructions

How the Certified Organic SEO Works

Once you set up the application:
	•	All queries will be modified to include the word organic (unless already present).
	•	Results will be filtered to prioritize certified organic products or content.
	•	You can customize the certification standards in the config.json file.

Adding the “+Organic” Button

The framework also enables the addition of a +Organic button next to the regular Search button on your search platform’s UI:
	1.	HTML Button: Add the following HTML button next to your search bar:

<button id="organic-search-button">+Organic</button>


	2.	JavaScript:
Add JavaScript to modify the search query when the +Organic button is clicked:

document.getElementById('organic-search-button').addEventListener('click', function() {
    let query = document.getElementById('search-input').value;
    window.location.href = "https://www.example-search.com?q=" + query + " organic";
});


	3.	CSS Styling:
Style the button to match your website’s theme:

#organic-search-button {
    background-color: green;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 16px;
}

Integration Guidelines for Search Engine Companies

If you are a developer working with a search engine platform, here are some steps you can take to integrate Certified Organic SEO into your search engine:
	1.	Identify the API Integration Points:
Search engines such as Google, Bing, and others provide APIs that can be used to programmatically retrieve search results. Modify the query processing by appending the word organic to each search request by default.
	2.	Develop a Specialized Organic Filter:
Customize your existing filtering algorithm to prioritize content marked with verified organic certifications (e.g., USDA Organic, EU Organic).
	3.	Support Schema.org Integration:
Ensure your search engine supports schema.org standards for organic products. This can include markup for certified organic products that appear in search results.
